# Visual Studio Code's Debugger feature

This Repo contains the example files used in VS Code Debugger Tutorial at <a href="https://www.learnbycheating.com/subjects/vscode/how-to-use-vscode-debugger">learnbycheating.com/subjects/vscode/how-to-use-vscode-debugger</a>

The repository displayed is the ending code.

To get the starting code, click the Releases link. There are two releases. 

v1-VS-Code-Debugger-starting-code.

v2-VS-Code-Debugger-ending-code.

Under the v1-VS-Code-Debugger-starting-code, click the Source Code link to download it. 

The only difference between the beginning and ending code is the addition of the custom launch.json file.
